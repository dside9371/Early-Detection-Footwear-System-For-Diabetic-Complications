# Early-Detection-Footwear-System-For-Diabetic-Complications
Project Description: 
Early detection is crucial to reduce the damage of the foot infections and ulcerations. This often does not happen because many diabetics experience the loss of sensation due to nerve damage.

There are 3 main points that make this system efficient, accurate, and reliable.
1) Communications.
  We used ble to connect the system parts together. Its power efficient and extremely fast. We used GSM to connect the system to the         database, so the system is always connected to the internet 
2) Power efficiency 
  We integrated 3 batteries that will keep the system alive for at least 2 weeks, and that period can be extended because we implemented     flexible solar panels in the shoe fabric, also, The system has a USB type-C input for fast charging 
3) Accuracy 
  We used super accurate thermo sensors that can detect the difference within one celsius degree and our ADC chips have the capability of   16x ADC Resolution. That means we will always be getting fast, accurate and reliable data.

-----System Operation-------

There are 6 temperature sensors in each foot. These sensors will monitor the skin temperature every few minutes. The ADC chips will compare the captured temperature data and send them to the website. The website will graph these data points to show if there is an infection detected.
